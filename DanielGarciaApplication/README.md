Hi my name is Daniel Garcia

this is my application: 
to build you need to set the enviroment variables ($CC) to the crosscompiler that you use

the "helloword" was compiled to work in an ARM processor, you can check it with this command line:
"file helloworld"
the output of the command:
"helloworld: ELF 32-bit LSB pie executable, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3, BuildID[sha1]=6319b82a4796fe09be4b56526331f7fa4534d7c3, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, with debug_info, not stripped"
